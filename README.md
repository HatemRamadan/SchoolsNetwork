# SchoolsNetwork
A website to the ministry of Education that provides a number of features to schools and parents. It will act as a portal where both groups can interact with each other.

The number of schools in Egypt is increasing every year. It is an important decision for parents to look
for the most appropriate school to enroll their children in. Parents try their best to collect information
about all the schools. They compare them according to the curriculum, facilities offered by the school,
activities, fees, etc.


This platform then would allow the parents to easily browse the needed information about schools. This
facilitates the process of choosing the school that suits their children. The website allows the parent
to apply for their children in one or more schools. Once the child is accepted in a school, he/she will be
considered as an enrolled student. Parents can then interact with their childâ€™s school online and follow
their progress. Students have access also to the website where they can view the courses and solve
their homework.
